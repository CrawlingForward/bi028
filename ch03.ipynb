    "### Versions of Regular Expression\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we turn into `grep`, let's first introduce three versions of regular expressions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Basic regular expression (BRE)**\n",
    "\n",
    "BRE suppress the special meaning of such metacharacters as <font color=\"red\">?, +, {, |, (, and )</font>. To use the metacharacter, these metacharacters should be escaped with backslash.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Extended regular expression (ERE)**\n",
    "\n",
    "In ERE, the above metacharacters have their own special meanings. To use the extended regular expression, `grep` should use the option `-E` instead of the option `-e`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Perl-style regular expression (PRE)**\n",
    "\n",
    "PRE is the most powerful regular expression, which also supports the lazy matching, while ERE does NOT.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the difference between ERE and PRE is that ERE does not support lazy matching, while PRE does. Here is the example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "echo \"see\" | grep -E \"e??\"\n",
    "echo \"see\" | grep -P \"e??\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "The regular expressions \"e?\" can match an empty string \"\", and the plural repeats of \"e\", \"e\", \"ee\" and etc. Therefore, due to the lazy matching of \"e?\" to an empty string, the second command will highlight nothing. However, the first command will highlight the substring \"ee\" in the string \"see\".  \n",
    "\n",
    "### What is `grep`?\n",
    "\n",
    "`grep` searches input files for lines containing a match to a given pattern list.  When it finds a match in a line, it copies the line to STDOUT (by default), or produces whatever other sort of output you have requested with options.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though `grep` expects to do the matching on text, it has no limits on input line length other than available memory, and it can match arbitrary characters within a line.  If the final byte of an input file is not a newline, `grep` silently supplies one.  Since newline is also a separator for the list of patterns, there is no way to match newline characters in a text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the SYNOPSIS for `grep`:\n",
