    "A bash script is a file containing bash commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the file executable, we must first take the following two steps. First, the script file should contain __shebang__ as its very first line.\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "#!/bin/bash\n",
    "```\n",
    "This specifies which program (`bash`) should be used to interpret the commands in the script.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the file permissions for the script should be set such that is it executable. \n",
    "```bash\n",
    "chmod u+x scriptname\n",
    "```\n",
    "The script can then be run like any other executable file:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "./scriptname\n",
    "```\n",
    "Actually, we can also run a script even without making the script executable, but this is less frequently done.\n",

    "bash scriptname\n",
    "```\n",

    "Write a bash script called `greet.sh` that prints a greeting to the user. Remember to insert the proper incantation on the first line of the script, and to set the file permissions to allow execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now modify your script greeting so that it\n",

    "- greets the user by (user)name,\n",

    "### Variables and Arithmetic Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete this exercise you will probably need to use variables and arithmetic comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables can be created and initialized as shown below. Note that there should NOT be a space between the variable name and the assignment operator.\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "varname=12\n",

    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "echo \"Value in varname is $varname.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that variables in a bash script are by default interpreted as charactersf. To get bash to interpret a value as a number, in order to do arithmetic operations including arithmetic comparisons, you must wrap the expression in __double-parentheses__. For example, you might say:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "if [ hour -lt 7 ]; then\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The arithmetic comparison operators are the same in bash as in C:\n",
    "```\n",
    "==  !=  <  <=  >  >=  &&  ||\n",
    "```\n",
    "Bash's other arithmetic operators are also reminiscent of C, with the addition of an operator for exponentiation (**).\n",
    "```\n",
    "+  -  ++  --  *  /  %  **\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### If statements\n",
    "\n",
    "Bash scripts also provide for a variety of program control structures, including conditionals, loops, and functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax for an __if-statement__ follows. As you would probably expect, __the elif and else clauses are optional, and the conditions and commands should be replaced with meaningful expressions__.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Note that the spaces that separate the square brackets from the conditions ARE required.__\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "if [ condition ]; then\n",
    "    command(s)\n",
    "elif [ condition ]; then\n",
    "    command(s)\n",
